## How it works
Efood-order-tracker automatically retrieves your order's data from the e-food order page and helps you keep track of how much of the waiting time has passed. It also displays an estimated arrival time, which is calculated based on the waiting time and information about the store you ordered from, like the store's name, logo and telephone.

Furthermore, when there's no order to track, efood-order-tracker can be used as a catalog, with quick-links to various options from the e-food Cuisine types (e.g. burgers, pizza, coffee etc.).

You can also use this extension to view interesting analytics about your orders, like top restaurants, total expenses, how many piniatas you've used etc. Simply, navigate to [your orders](https://www.e-food.gr/account/orders) page and click on the Analytics button!
