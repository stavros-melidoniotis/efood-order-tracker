# efood-order-tracker
Chrome extension that keeps track of time for your e-food orders.

## How it works
Efood-order-tracker automatically retrieves your order's data from the e-food order page and helps you keep track of how much of the waiting time has passed. It also displays an estimated arrival time, which is calculated based on the waiting time and information about the store you ordered from, like the store's name, logo and telephone.

Furthermore, when there's no order to track, efood-order-tracker can be used as a catalog, with quick-links to various options from the e-food Cuisine types (e.g. burgers, pizza, coffee etc.).

## How to install
Efood-order-tracker isn't yet listed in the Chrome Webstore, because it's in Pending Review status. This section will be updated in the future with the actual link from the Chrome Webstore.

Until then, you can install the extension by following the instructions below:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode (upper right corner) and click the "Load unpacked" button
4. Find the cloned repo on your computer and select it, then press "Open"

The extension is loaded into Chrome and ready to be used!
